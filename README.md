# PQ verifiers for Starknet accounts

[![CI](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/OpenZeppelin/cairo-pq-verifiers/efficiency.yml?branch=main&label=CI)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-pq-verifiers/actions/workflows/efficiency.yml)

_Comparing candidate post-quantum signature verifiers for a Starknet account by their
verification cost._

## Why

Starknet's STARK proofs are post-quantum. The ECDSA signatures that authorize account
transactions are not, and Shor's algorithm could forge them. Because Starknet accounts are
smart contracts (account abstraction), a post-quantum account can ship today by swapping the
check inside `__validate__`, provided that verification fits Starknet's validation limits.
This repo measures which schemes fit, and which is cheapest — and ships deployable
post-quantum accounts you can try today (see below).

## What we measure

For each scheme, the cost of verifying one signature, both alone and inside a real
`__validate__`: L2 gas, Cairo steps, signature and key size, contract class size, and where
the steps go.

Validation is capped at 1,000,000 steps and 100,000,000 L2 gas (blockifier v0.13.4;
both unchanged as of Starknet 0.14.3), so a verifier has to fit under both.

These are resource measurements — steps and builtins priced with the protocol gas table.
Transaction **fees** meter L2 gas differently for Sierra ≥ 1.7 classes and run between
about 1.7× and 2.7× these values, depending on the variant. The CLI prints live receipt
gas; the fee meter and devnet-measured receipts per scheme are documented in
[`pq-accounts/USAGE.md`](pq-accounts/USAGE.md#what-transactions-cost).

## Snapshot

Current efficiency of every measured entry, per crate (the values pinned in
[`efficiency_baseline.json`](efficiency_baseline.json); caps are 100,000,000 L2 gas and
1,000,000 steps):

ECDSA-STARK is the classical scheme in use today, a cost reference rather than a PQ
candidate. Falcon-512 is the first PQ verifier measured, in five variants that share one
NTT-domain public key and a canonical 29-felt base-Q encoding. Packed coefficients are
validated and decoded directly to `u16`. The hint variants use two generated, fully unrolled
Falcon-512 forward transforms from the shared [`ntt`](crates/ntt) crate, followed by a fused
pointwise hint check and norm pass. The two direct variants (`falcon_512_direct`,
`falcon_512_shake_direct`) instead compute `INTT(NTT(s1) ∘ h_ntt)`, using the generated
forward transform and the generic inverse engine. They trade a more expensive inverse
transform for almost half the signature calldata (31 vs 60 felts) and no signer-supplied
hint. The variants otherwise differ only in the on-chain hash-to-point that binds the
message:

- **BLAKE2s** (hint and direct): a non-standard XOF swap via the `core::blake` builtin.
  Nearly the cheapest, but needs a matching signer.
- **Poseidon**: a native `hades_permutation` squeeze. Message-binding, the cheapest variant
  (marginally below BLAKE2s), and the most STARK-proving-friendly since it uses native field
  arithmetic. Also non-standard.
- **SHAKE-256**: the standard Falcon hash-to-point, interoperable with any compliant signer
  (e.g. falcon.py). The pure-Cairo Keccak-f[1600] (flat unrolled rounds, u128 lanes, lazy
  block squeezing) dominates this backend, so even the standards-compliant variant fits
  both validation caps. Its bare hint verifier uses about 4.2× the gas and 3.2× the steps
  of the native-Poseidon variant. A native
  `keccak_f1600` syscall ([SNIP-32](https://github.com/starknet-io/SNIPs)) would close the
  remaining gap. It comes in hint and direct forms; `falcon_512_shake_direct` carries no
  hint, mirroring a bare FIPS signature most closely, and is the most expensive of the five.

All five use genuine falcon.py-signed fixtures and fit the validation caps — the non-standard
variants with wide margin, and the SHAKE-256 accounts at 51.7–61.9% of the gas cap and
32.7–42.8% of the step cap.

All five derive the message point on-chain from `message_hash`, which binds the signature to
the message. At s2morrow commit `4eff9ab`, its packed Poseidon verifier measures 81,212 steps
with Scarb 2.15.1 and Starknet Foundry 0.55.0, versus 97,681 here with Scarb 2.18.0 and
Starknet Foundry 0.59.0. That comparison is directional, not protocol-equivalent:
[s2morrow](https://github.com/feltroidprime/s2morrow) uses a different Poseidon
absorb-and-extract construction, while this verifier preserves its existing 16-bit-word
rejection stream. The NTT and packing costs here are already comparable to or below
s2morrow's; the remaining gap is concentrated in hash-to-point and the fused verification
core. Each variant also has an account contract measured inside `__validate__`, where the
realistic cost sits just above bare verify (the verifier dominates; dispatch, the 29-slot key
read, and deserialization are small). The remaining PQ verifiers are stubs behind the same
interface.

## Try the accounts

[`pq-accounts/`](pq-accounts) holds deployable SNIP-6 account contracts for every measured
verifier, plus three ways to drive them: a CLI whose devnet quickstart declares, funds,
deploys, and transacts in one command; an MCP server exposing the same operations to LLM
clients; and a local wallet daemon that plugs the accounts into browser dapps (they appear
in Voyager's connect-wallet dialog and sign contract calls with Falcon). The walkthrough
is [`pq-accounts/USAGE.md`](pq-accounts/USAGE.md), including deploying to Sepolia.

## Report

`make report` regenerates these from the latest run:

```
results/report.html      # standalone HTML: sortable table, charts, profiler attribution
results/summary.md       # text summary
results/results.json     # raw data plus metadata
```

## Run

The toolchain is pinned in `.tool-versions` (Scarb 2.18.0, Starknet Foundry 0.59.0,
cairo-profiler 0.16.0, plus starknet-devnet 0.9.0 for the
[`pq-accounts`](pq-accounts/USAGE.md) walkthrough). Install it with
[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) or [starkup](https://github.com/software-mansion/starkup).

```bash
make all        # measure, profile, then render the report
make test       # run the test suite
make check-eff  # efficiency ratchet: fail if any tracked cost regressed
make ratchet    # lock measured improvements into efficiency_baseline.json
```

Efficiency is a one-way ratchet: `efficiency_baseline.json` pins the cost of every
tracked benchmark pair (L2 gas and steps), CI fails any change that raises a number,
and improvements are committed via `make ratchet`.

## Schemes

| Crate | Scheme | Family | Standardization |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`ecdsa_stark`](crates/ecdsa_stark) | ECDSA-STARK | classical EC (control) | none |
| [`falcon_512`](crates/falcon_512) | Falcon-512 (FN-DSA); BLAKE2s hint+direct, SHAKE-256 hint+direct, Poseidon variants | lattice (NTRU) | draft, FIPS 206 (standard SHAKE-256; non-standard BLAKE2s / Poseidon) |
| [`ml_dsa_44`](crates/ml_dsa_44) | ML-DSA-44 (Dilithium) | lattice (module) | final, FIPS 204 |
| [`poseidon_wots`](crates/poseidon_wots) | Poseidon-WOTS+ | hashing | not standardized |

## Method

Every scheme implements the one interface in
[`crates/bench_interface`](crates/bench_interface); each cost is the measured test minus a
baseline test that builds the same inputs but omits the verify call. Bare verify covers the
function alone. The validate scenario deploys an account mock from
[`crates/bench_targets`](crates/bench_targets) and calls it, which adds dispatch,
signature deserialization, and a storage read. Numbers come from Starknet Foundry (gas,
steps, builtins), a release build (class size), and cairo-profiler (attribution by
function).
