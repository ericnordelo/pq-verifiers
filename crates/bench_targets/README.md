# Benchmark accounts

**Component:** the account harness for the in-`__validate__` scenario: one deployable
account contract per verifier.
**Status:** measured (ECDSA-STARK and the five Falcon-512 variants); other PQ verifiers'
accounts land as their schemes are implemented.

Unlike the verifier crates (one scheme each), this crate collects **one account contract
per verifier**, each in its own module. An account wraps its scheme the way a Starknet
account would: `validate()` reads the transaction hash and signature from the transaction
info, loads the stored public key, and runs the scheme's `verify`. Measuring a
deploy-and-call of it (minus a deploy-only baseline) captures the realistic validation
cost (dispatch, signature deserialization, and the key's storage read) on top of bare
verification, and building the contracts yields each scheme's contract-class size.

All accounts expose the same `IValidateBench` interface, defined at the crate root.

```
src/
  lib.cairo          # IValidateBench + one module per verifier account
  ecdsa_stark.cairo  # EcdsaStarkAccount (classical control)
  falcon_512.cairo   # Falcon512Account (hint) + Falcon512DirectAccount (direct)
                     #   + Falcon512ShakeAccount (SHAKE-256) + Falcon512PoseidonAccount
                     #   + Falcon512ShakeDirectAccount (SHAKE-256 direct)
```

## Current efficiency

One row per verifier account. The 100M-L2-gas / 1M-step validation cap is the deployability
threshold, and every account fits it: the BLAKE2s, direct, and Poseidon Falcon accounts with
wide margin, and the two SHAKE-256 accounts (hint and direct) — whose pure-Cairo SHAKE-256
hash-to-point dominates their cost — at 51.7–61.9% of the gas cap and 32.7–42.8% of the
step cap.
